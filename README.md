# Arduino_ST4_Controller
Generates the control pulses required for the motors controller, corresponding to the ASCOM/INDI commands.
It feeds the North, South, East, West, Focuser IN and Focuser OUT control lines to the DEC, RA and focuser stepper controller (another project I haven't uploaded yet).
It works with ASCOM and INDI.
The commands addapted for the new Adafruit TFT are creating problems on the code (soft buttons and output lines stuck ver often if pressed for long times).
